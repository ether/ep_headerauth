# `ep_headerauth`

Etherpad plugin to use a reverse proxy's HTTP headers for authentication.

If the `X-Authenticated-User` header is present in the HTTP request coming from
your reverse proxy, then the user is considered to have already been
authenticated by your reverse proxy. The header's value is used as the user's
username.

If the `X-Authenticated-Name` header is present, the user's displayed name is
forced to that header's value.

The headers used by the plugin can be customized.

## Configuration

In your `settings.json`:

```
{
  // ...
  "trustProxy": true,
  "headerauth": {
    // Defaults to "x-authenticated-user"
    "username_header": "x-authenticated-user",
    // Defaults to "x-authenticated-name"
    "displayname_header": "x-authenticated-name"
  },
  // ...
}
```
